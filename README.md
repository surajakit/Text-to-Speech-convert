Description
This project implements a simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality using HTML and JavaScript. The application converts text input into speech by using the SpeechSynthesis API, which is a built-in web browser feature. This allows the browser to read aloud any text entered by the user.

The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can type or paste text, press a button, and listen to the text being read aloud.

Features
Convert typed text to speech using the browser's built-in capabilities.
Adjust the pitch and rate of the speech.
Simple and intuitive user interface.
Works across modern web browsers that support the SpeechSynthesis API.
