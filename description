Description:

Text-to-speech (TTS) is a technology that converts written text into spoken words. Using HTML and JavaScript, you can easily implement a TTS functionality in a web page. This allows the browser to read out loud the text entered by the user or dynamically displayed on the screen. It’s a useful feature for accessibility, educational tools, and user engagement.

Here’s a breakdown of how you can create a simple Text-to-Speech functionality using HTML and JavaScript:

How it Works:
HTML Interface: You create a basic input field or a text area where the user can type or paste the text they want to be read out loud. You can also add a button to trigger the speech.

JavaScript API: JavaScript uses the SpeechSynthesis API, which is a built-in browser feature that allows you to turn text into speech. This API provides methods to control the speech, including pitch, rate, and voice selection.

Steps to Create Text-to-Speech:
HTML Structure:

A textarea or input element where users can type the text.
A button element to trigger the speech.
Optional: A dropdown to select the language or voice.
JavaScript Code:

Use the SpeechSynthesisUtterance object to create the speech.
Pass the text content to this object.
Use the speechSynthesis.speak() method to play the speech.
Customize the voice, pitch, and rate using the available properties.
